## 📸 Usage Guide

### Managing Galleries
1.  Navigate to **Galleries** in the Admin Sidebar.
2.  Create a nice Album (e.g., "Transylvanian Winters").
3.  Upload photos using the **drag-and-drop zone**.
4.  Star your favorite galleries to feature them on the Dashboard.

### Journal / Blog
1.  Go to **Posts**.
2.  Write your story using the rich editor.
3.  **Link a Gallery**: Select a gallery to automatically pull its cover image as the post header.
4.  **Editor Mode**: If you give a user "Editor" permissions, they can polish the text but cannot accidentally delete the post.
